This repository contains some Python/Jupyter files that demonstrate the functionality of the Sarus Monitor+ API.
The demos use some historic European Central bank rates to show some basic to advanced analytic reoport notebooks.
The reports are designed to demonstrate just what can be easily achieved with a few lines of Python code and are <b>not in ANY way</b> meant to be solutions. 
This repository is mainly used as a test bed to test for running the demos in Binder.

## About Monitor+
Monitor+ is a commercial JSON Web API that provides easy access to a huge range of historical reference market data from stock exchanges, commodity exchanges, proprietary market data providers and independent pricing agencies as well as currencies, global indices and more.

Monitor+ is an extremely powerful API, with comprehensive data preprocessing, fills, lead/lags, custom averages and more. The Monitor+ API  enables subscribers to easily receive market data for multiple datasets in a per date, time series or row by column JSON format.
